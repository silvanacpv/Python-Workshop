    "A box plot is a way to show what a bunch of numbers look like, helping us see how the numbers are spread out and if there are any unusual values. Here's what you need to know about box plots in simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Box: The main part of the plot is the box. It shows where the middle 50% of the numbers fall. Think of it as the central area where most of the numbers are.\n",
    "- Lines at the Top and Bottom of the Box (Whiskers): These lines extend from the box. They show how far the numbers go without including the unusual ones. They usually stop at a point that's 1.5 times the box's height (which is called the \"interquartile range\" or IQR).\n",
    "- Middle Line Inside the Box: This line shows the median, which is the middle point of all the numbers when they are sorted from smallest to largest.\n",
    "-  Dots Outside the Whiskers: These dots represent outliers. Outliers are numbers that are quite far from most of the data. They stand out because they are either much larger or much smaller than the others.\n",
